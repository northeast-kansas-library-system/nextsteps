Checking items in
*****************

**(AKA Checkin is your friend)**


Overview of check-in
====================

Checking items in accomplishes many things in Next Search Catalog:

- Check-in puts items that have been borrowed back into circulation
- Check-in removes "Lost" and "Missing" statuses from items that have been marked as "Lost" or "Missing"
- Check-in puts items into transit when they need to be shipped to other libraries
- Check-in takes items out of transit when they arrive at their destination
- Check-in triggers the different phases of the requests/holds process
- Check-in triggers the "Recently returned" shelving location process
- Check-in updates an items "Last seen" date to the current date

The bottom line is that, if you're not sure what to do with an item, checking it in will get the system to tell you what to do with it.

Finding the Check-in menu
=========================

The check-in menu can be found on the circulation menu

|checkin.0110|

|checkin.0120|

The check-in menu can also be found by checking an item in using the flexible search box (which can be found at the top of almost every page).

|checkin.0130|

After you enter a barcode number through "Check in" on the flexible search box, that item will be checked in and you will be taken to the check-in menu.
