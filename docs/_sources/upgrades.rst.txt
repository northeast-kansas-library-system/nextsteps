Koha Upgrades
=============

Next Search Catalog uses :term:`Koha` as its :term:`integrated library system <Integrated library system>`.  

The Koha community releases a new version of Koha every six months, in May and November of each year.  Knowing which version of Koha we are using can tell you when the version was released.  Koha 16.05 was released in May of 2016.  The 16 in 16.05 indicates the year and the .05 indicates the month.  Koha 21.11 was released in November of 2021; Koha 28.05 will be relased in May of 2028; and so on.

Currently we try to keep Next Search Catalog one version behind the most current version of Koha.  This means that when Koha 28.05 releases in May of 2028, we will upgrade to Koha 27.11 by the end of August, 2028.  Staying one version behind the current version of Koha helps us avoid the software bugs usually associated with a brand new release.

Our upgrade schedule for the next few years is tentatively scheduled to look something like this:

+------------+---------------+
| Version    | Date          |

| Koha 23.05 | January, 2024 |
