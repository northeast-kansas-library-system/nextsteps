How to import lists from Koha
=============================


If a borrower had created lists in the Koha OPAC and they want to transfer those lists into Aspen Discovery, follow these steps:


1. Log into Aspen Discovery and click on "Your Lists"

  |import_lists_from_koha-0030|

2. Click on the "Import From Old Catalog" button

  |import_lists_from_koha-0041|

3. Aspen Discovery will automatically re-create the Koha OPAC list in Aspen Discovery 

  |import_lists_from_koha-0050|

4. Go to "Your Lists" to see the imported list 

  |import_lists_from_koha-0060|

5. When you open the list in Aspen Discovery it will have the same contents as the list in the Koha OPAC 

  |import_lists_from_koha-0070|
