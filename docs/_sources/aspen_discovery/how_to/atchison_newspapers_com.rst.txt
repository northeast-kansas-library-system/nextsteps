5. Success!

Possible problems:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- If you get to step 2 and you get a "Your library does not provide access ot this resource" message, this means that the logged in user does not have Atchison Public Library listed in their account as their home library

- If you get to step 5 and you get a "The barcode is incorrect" message, then the library card number you've entered does not match the card number authentication rules that Atchison Public Library gave to newspapers.com.
