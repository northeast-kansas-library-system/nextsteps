Force reindex
=============

Aspen Discovery reindexes records regularly overnight.  If you make a change to a record and you want Aspen Discovery to reindex it as soon as possible, you can force Aspen Discovery to add a record to the reindexing queue.

1. While logged in to a staff account in Aspen Discovery, go to the record and click on "Staff View"

  |force_reindex-0010|

2. In the "Staff View" panel, click on "Force Reindex"

  |force_reindex-0020|

3. You should see a pop-up message saying "This title will be indexed again shortly"

  |force_reindex-0030|

4. Wait several minutes, then go back to the record and force a page load by typing CTRL-SHIFT-R.  The changes to the bibliographic record should now be reflected in Aspen Discovery.  Please note that depending on the server load, it may take as long as 15 minutes for a record to be reindexed.
