    <p>Generates data for:</p> 
    <ul> 
      <li>BORROWER_ACCT_USED_LM = number of borrower accounts used to check out materials last month</li> 
      <li>TOTAL_BORROWERS = number of total borrowers with this home library</li>

    <p></p> 
    <p>These counts are current at the time the report is run (which for Next Search Catalog is usually between 12:01 a.m. and 4:00 a.m. on the first day of the month).</p>
