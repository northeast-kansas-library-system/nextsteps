    <ul><li>during the previous calendar month</li> 
    <li>at all system libraries</li> 
    <li>grouped and sorted by checkout-library and borrower zipcode</li>

    <ul> 
      <li>Zip codes on borrower records are only as accurate as the staff members who entered those zip codes into the borrower records.  There are hundreds of incorrect and non-standard zip codes in the borrower data.</li> 
      <li>All zip codes are trimmed to 5 digits</li>  
      <li>If BORROWER_ZIPCODE = "-" that means there are less than 10 borrowers with that zip code system-wide<br />in order to protect borrower privacy, if there are fewer than 10 borrowers in a zip code, that zip code will be hidden.</li> 
      <li>If BORROWER_ZIPCODE = "0" that means that the zipdcode that has been left blank, that zipcode contains nothing but spaces, or that zipcode is set to zero</li> 
    </ul>
