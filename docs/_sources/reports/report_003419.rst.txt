    <p class="updated">SHELVING_LOCATION is based on the shelving location of the item at the time it was checked out *Unless the item had a "Recently returned" shelving location.*  This report falls back to the items' "Permanent shelving location" whenever the statistics data shows that the item's shelving location was "Recently returned."  If the shelving location is completely ambiguous, the circulation is counted as a "Youth" circulation in the CR_YOUTH_LM column.</p>
