    <p>Monthly overview - items loaned to and borrowed from other libraries in Next Search Catalog</p> 
    <ul><li>Shows item transfer counts for the previous calendar month</li> 
    <li>At all Next Search Catalog libraries</li> 
    <li>grouped and sorted by branch name</li> 
    </ul><br /> 
    <p><ins>Notes:</ins></p> 
    <p></p> 
    <p>Generates data for:</p> 
    <ul> 
      <li>NX_ILL_LOANED_LM = count of items your library loaned to another Next Search Catalog library last month</li> 
      <li>NX_ILL_BORROWED_LM = count of items your library borrowed from another Next Search Catalog library last month</li> 
    </ul> 
    <p></p> 
    <p>These counts are are based on whether you shipped or received an item via the Kansas Library Express courier.  Whether or not the item was actually checked out to a borrower is irrelevant in this count because, whether or not loaned to a borrower, the item was loaned to another library or borrowed from your library.</p>
