    <p><ins>Notes:</ins></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>This report was updated and fixed on January 5, 2022</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Please note that, because this report gathers data from the issues and oldissues tables in Koha, you cannot see accurate data from more than 13 months old.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Also note that this report cannot count the circulation of items that have been deleted.  If an item circulates 50 times on Tuesday, but is deleted on Wednesday, it will not be counted by this report if the report is run on Thursday.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p><ins>The report will almost certainly fail if you use extremely broad parameters.  If you try to run this report with "All libraries" as the checkout branch, "All libraries" as the item home branch, and no limits on shelving locations, item types, or collection codes and a date range longer than just a few weeks, the report will almost certainly fail and may slow down Koha while it runs.</ins></p>
