    <p></p>
    <p>Requests have many dates associated with them.  One of these dates is labeled as 'reserves.expirationdate' in the database.</p>
    <p>This 'expirationdate' date is an internal date that the Koha software uses to determine if a request has been waiting for longer than 7 days.  During the upgrade on December 9, 2017, 'expirationdate' dates on all waiting requests were reset by this bug to 2017-12-09 from their original dates.  This causes the "Holds awaiting pickup report" at https://staff.nexpresslibrary.org/cgi-bin/koha/circ/waitingreserves.pl to fail to show any requests that have been waiting more than 7 days on the "Holds waiting over 7 days" tab.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>This report shows the actual expiration dates of any requests that were waiting prior to December 9, 2017.</p>
