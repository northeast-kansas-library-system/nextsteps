    <p>Counts circulation (checkouts and renewals) based on flexible date settings</p>
    <ul><li>Counts circulation based on the date parameters you set</li>
    <li>at the library you choose</li>
    <li>grouped and sorted by checkout branch and date of checkout</li>
    </ul><br />
    <p><ins>Notes:</ins></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Please note that items renewed via the OPAC are counted as renewals at the library where the item was checked out.  Therefore, if you see a circulation count at a library on a day that the library is normally closed, it is almost certainly due to a renewal initiated by the patron via the OPAC.</p>
