    <p><ins>Notes:</ins></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Starting in January of 2017, all NExpress items that were overdue more than 45 days began to be moved from being checked-out to being checked in with a "Lost (overdue more than 45 days)" status unless the items were checked out to patrons in certain categories (i.e. student/teacher/inhouse, etc).  Please take this into consideration when looking at the number of overdue items that are checked in when they are 46 days overdue.  These items will almost always be items that were automatically changed from overdue to "Lost."</p>
