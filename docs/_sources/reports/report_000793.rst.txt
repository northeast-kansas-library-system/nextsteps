    <p>NX_ILL_LOANED_LM = the number of items owned by your library that were shipped "in transit" to another library during the month.</p>
    <p>NX_ILL_BORROWED_LM = the number of items not owned by your library that arrived "in transit" to your library during the month.</p>
    <p>This report does not take into account whether the item was actually checked out by a borrower - it only considers that the item was shipped from or to your library.</p>
