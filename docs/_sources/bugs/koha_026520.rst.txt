November 2023 - Default messaging preferences bug
=================================================

This bug only occurs when you create a new borrower **AND** you try to un-check **all** of the default messaging preferences.  Once the borrower has been created, the messaging preferences can be removed, but only *after* the borrower has been created.

This is `Koha bug 26250 <https://bugs.koha-community.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=26520>`_ and has existed since at least 2020.  The circumstances to re-create the bug are unusual, though, so no one in our system reported it until 2023.

Steps to re-create the bug 
--------------------------

1. Follow the normal steps to create a new borrower:

    A. Click on "Patrons"
    B. Click on "New patron" and choose a borrower category 
    C. Fill out the new patron form as normal
    D. Scroll to the "Patron messaging preferences" section at the bottom of the page

2. Note that several of the messaging preferences in this section are checked by default

3. Un-check **ALL** of the messaging preferences and then click on "Save"

    (this bug only occurs when you un-check **ALL** of the checkboxes)

4. On the borrower's details page, note that the messaging preferences have all re-set back to their default settings
