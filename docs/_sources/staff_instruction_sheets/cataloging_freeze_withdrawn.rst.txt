Deleting items during the cataloging freeze work-around 
======================================================= 
 
During April and the first few weeks of May 2023 we will be adding authority control to Next Search Catalog.  During the initial batch loading of the authority records, staff will not be able to delete items from Next Search Catalog in the normal manner. 
 
The work-around for deleting items during the cataloging freeze is to mark the items as "Withdrawn during cataloging freeze" during the cataloging freeze.  Then shortly after the cataloging freeze has ended, NEKLS staff will delete all items marked with a withdrawn status of "Withdrawn during cataloging freeze." 
 
 
Deleting a single item 
---------------------- 
 
1. On the title's details page, click on the "Edit" button for the item on the holdings table 
 
  |cataloging_freeze_0010| 
 
2. Change the "Withdrawn status" of the item to "Withdrawn during cataloging freeze" and click on "Save changes" 
 
  |cataloging_freeze_0020| 
 
3. The details page should now show that the item is marked as "Withdrawn during cataloging freeze"
