A Brief History of the Integrated Library System
================================================

Library catalogs have been around as long as libraries have.  In its most basic form, a library catalog is a list of all of the titles owned by a library.

The earliest form of library catalog was the librarian.  In the ancient world, the easiest way to locate an item in the library was to ask the librarian.  The problem with this, of course, is that the catalog was only as good as the librarian and it only lasted as long as the librarian did.  To help manage their collections and their memories, librarians wrote stuff down.

Up until the late 1780s, most early library catalogs consisted of books containing lists of the titles that were housed in a library and those catalog books were updated from time to time.  The problem with storing catalog information in a book comes when you add or remove books from the library's collection.  After the invention of the printing press and the mass production of books began, keeping a catalog in a book either meant that the book needed to be updated and re-printed regularly (which was costly and time consuming) or libraries had to keep lists of new titles in supplemental volumes (which makes searching cumbersome).  This all changed in the 1790s.

During the French Revolution, the Revolutionary government seized property from the church including books and libraries and those books were used to create a French national library system.  Librarians had to come up with a way to quickly and easily train people in local communities how to manage their newly acquired library collections which were really in a state of chaos.  Librarians dealt with the turmoil created by the flood of confiscated books by writing down bibliographic information on the backs of playing cards.  Playing cards were readily available and, at that time, the backs of cards were usually blank.  Because cards were more durable than slips of paper and because cards were easy to sort, file, and resort when new books were added to a collection, within 50 years card catalogs were being widely adopted by libraries around the world as the standard form of maintaining a catalog.

In the USA, by 1900 the Library of Congress had become the de-facto national library of the United States and they had a division that was devoted just to the production of library catalog cards.  It's important to know, though, that they didn't just produce cards for the catalog at the Library of Congress.  It was possible (up until the 1990s) for libraries in the USA to purchase copies of existing Library of Congress catalog cards for use in their own public libraries through the Cataloging Distribution Service.

The problem for the Library of Congress was that, by the mid 1960s, they had acquired close to 9 million titles and their card catalog was taking up a massive amount of space.

At the same time as the catalogers were trying to figure out how to create, organize, and store information about the library's holdings, other libraries also had to start dealing with the question of how to create, organize, and store information about library users.  Up until around 1800, most libraries did not loan their materials and when they did there were so few borrowers that keeping track of circulation was not too difficult.  When libraries began to let most users borrow books, it became necessary to set up systems for inventory control.  Most of these systems again involved books.  Most libraries used ledgers that included a page for each registered library user.  Then, underneath their registration information would be a list of what they had checked out, when it was due, etc.  Similarly to using books for the library catalog, this practice had a lot of disadvantages.

A change happened in the 1930s with the invention of the library card.  Users were no longer tracked by names on sheet of paper in a ledger, circulation cards were added to books and borrowers were tracked by numbers in new circulation filing systems.
