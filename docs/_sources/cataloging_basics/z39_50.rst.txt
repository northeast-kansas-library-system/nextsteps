How to copy a bibliographic record using Z39.50
***********************************************

**Don't forget to search for a title first** *before* **you bring in a new record via Z39.50**

Please refer to the serching instructions :ref:`here <Search for an existing bibliographic record - best practices>` for more information.

Searching Z39.50
================

    A. Select "Home > More > Cataloging"

        |search_for_existing_0010|

    B. Click on the "New from Z39.50" button

        |z39_50_0020|

    C. Enter the :term:`ISBN` number or :term:`UPC` number from the item you are searching for and click "Search"

        - NOTE:  The ISBN number is ususally embedded in the UPC, so scanning the UPC on a book usually populates the ISBN - however, the official ISBN for a book is usually found on the back of the book's title page
        - NOTE:  Self-published titles often do not include an ISBN

        |z39_50_0030|

    D. If you do not get any results, you should try searching again by author or title

        |z39_50_0040|

    E. If you find a match, click on the action button on the right and choose "MARC" or "Card" to pre-view the record and make sure that the record is a good match

        - NOTE:  Generally speaking, the more data you see in the "Card" preview, the better the record

        |z39_50_0050|

    F. If you find a match and the top results are highlighted in yellow and the server name is "#NEXT SEARCH CATALOG" it means that we already have a bibliographic record in the catalog that matches your search terms

        - If this happens, please double check and make sure that the record already in Next does not match the record you're trying to add

        |z39_50_0055|

    F. If you do find a matching record you want to add to Next, click on "Import" to add the record to our catalog

        |z39_50_0060|

    G. Once the record has been imported you can make changes to the MARC record as necessary and then click the "Save" button to finalize the import.

        - Specifically, you must update the record's 942$e, 942$c, and 942$h

          |z39_50_0070|

        - If the item does not have a 040$d and you do not know the OCLC code for your library, please input "cz5" (the NEKLS OCLC code - it's OK, it works just fine for our purposes)

          |z39_50_0080|

    H. After the bibliographic record has been saved, you will be redirected to the add items page so you can add your items to the new record.

No results found in Z39.50 after first attempt
==============================================

If you don't find any items via a Z39.50 it is not a bad idea to repeat the search a couple of different ways.

  - You can re-do the search using different data.

          |z39_50_0040|

  - You can select different catalogs to search in (not all catalogs are searched by default).

No results found in Z39.50 after several attempts
=================================================

If no search returns a result in Z39.50, you should move on to :doc:`searching for the item in ShareIt </cataloging_basics/shareit>`
