Search for an existing bibliographic record - best practices
============================================================

When you are trying to add an item to Next Search Catalog, the first thing you want to do is to search to see if a copy already exists in the catalog.  The steps below outline the best practices for searching Next Search Catalog thouroughly.


1. Search by ISBN
-----------------

    A. Select "Home > More > Cataloging"

        |search_for_existing_0010|

    B. Search for the item by ISBN or or UPC number (you can usually do this simply by scanning the UPC label on the item)

        |search_for_existing_0020|

    C. If you find results, verify that the items actually match by verifying the ISBN in the 020$a, or the UPC number in the 024$a but also verify that the title, author, year, publisher, physical description (page numbers, large print, etc.) match

        |search_for_existing_0030|

        |search_for_existing_0040|

    D. If you have a match, add your item to the existing record

2. Search by author/title
-------------------------

    A. If you do not find a match on the ISBN or UPC number, you should then do a search by title/author. It is possible that a copy exists that matches in every way except ISBN or UPC number. This can especially be true for items that are quite old or have been self-published

        |search_for_existing_0050|

    B. If you find a match based on title/author, go to step C above and verify that the year, publisher, physical description (page numbers, large print, etc.) match

    C. If you have a match, you can just add the item you're cataloging to the existing record

3. Look for records to copy from outside of Next
------------------------------------------------

If you do not find a match already in Next Search Catalog, your next step in adding an item to Next Search Catalog is to look to other cataloging resources.
