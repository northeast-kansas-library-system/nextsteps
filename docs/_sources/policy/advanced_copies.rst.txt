Proposed change to policy manual
================================

Advanced copies and Pirated material policy
-------------------------------------------

The Next Search Catalog administrators reserve the right to remove any advanced copies or pirated materials found in Next Search Catalog.

Advanced copies
---------------

Advanced Copies (also known as galleys; proofs; promotional copies; review editions; advanced reading copies; advanced viewing copies; screeners; promo copies; and various othe names) are copies of material that publishers and media companies give to people in the book and media business world to allow those people to write reviews and generate interest in a product or publication before the material is officially released for sale to the public.

Advanced copies are:

  - Lower quality paperback bindings (books)
  - In paper sleeves instead of cases (CDs, DVDs, other disc media)
  - Still in the process of being edited
  - Almost always stamped with phrases like "Advanced copy - not for sale"

It is not ethical to add advanced copies of materials to a public library catalog.

Pirated material
----------------

Pirated materials (also known as bootlegs; camrips; unauthorized copies; black-market editions; and various other names) are editions of materials that are produced without authorization from the copyright owner.

Adding pirated copies of materials to a public catalog is illegal.  Pirated materials are made with the express intent of selling materials that the poducer of the materials does not have the legal right to sell.
