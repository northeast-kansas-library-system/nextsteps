Q: Can I use a list of all of the borrowers at my library that have e-mail addresses so I can add those addresses to a library e-mail list?

A: No.  This violates the Next Search Catalog privacy and confidentiality statement that all staff members are asked to read and sign every year - `2024 privacy and confidentiality statement <https://nextkansas.org/Files/18/ViewPDF>`_.

The best practice is to create an e-mail list
