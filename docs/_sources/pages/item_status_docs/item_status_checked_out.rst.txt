*Checked out* status
====================

There are, effctively, two "Checked out" statuses:

- Checked out
- Overdue

From the item's bibliographic record the status for both checked out and overdue items will say "Checked out to LIBRARYCARD until mm/dd/yyyy."  The only way to tell that an item is overdue is by looking at the date.

From a borrower's record, overdue items will show the due date highlighted in red.
