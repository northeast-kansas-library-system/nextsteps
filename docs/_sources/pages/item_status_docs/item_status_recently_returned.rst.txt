*Recently returned*
===================

Recently returned is actually a shelving location, but it works similar to a status and many staff describe it as a status.  The "Recently returned" shelving location is added as a temporary location to items when they are checked in.  Approximately 18 hours after an item is checked in, the "Recently returned" status is removed and the shelving location is restored to its permanent shelving location.
