What happens at check-in
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Because not-for-loan items are considered *available* items in the catalog, checking in a not-for-loan item is exactly like checking in any other available item.

#. The item's "Last seen" date is updated to the current date
#. The item's shelving location is temporarily updated to "Recently returned"
#. A check-in messages appears ths should be similar to this:
