Reset a staff password using the OPAC
-------------------------------------

If you need to change a password for a staff account *and* there is an e-mail address on the account, you can set a new password by clicking on the "Forgot your password" text on the login page.

Note: most staff accounts such as LIBRARYCIRC; LIBRARYTECH; and LIBRARYDIRECTOR have the default e-mail address for that library on the account as their e-mail address.  If you do not normally have access to this account or are unsure which email account goes with your account, this method will not work for you.

1. Go to the OPAC at `https://nextkansas.org <https://nextkansas.org>`_ and click on "Log into your account."
