Clear screen icons
==================

When you've finished checking items out to a borrower, a great deal of confidential information is left on the screen.  The best practice is to clear the screen after you've finished checking materials out to the borrower.

- To clear the screen, click the "X" icon on the right hand side of the "Checking out to . . ." area

- The printer icon to the left of the "X" serves two functions

  #. It prints the "Receipt-today's checkouts" receipt when clicked
  #. It also clears the confidential data from the screen
