What are "Lists" in Next Search Catalog
=======================================

Lists give staff a place where they can create a list of bibliographic records from the catalog.  Lists can be public or private and you can set lists so that anyone who can view the list can add or remove titles from the list.

Lists should not be confused with the "Cart" feature in Next Search Catalog.  The "Cart" is a temporary place to store bibliographic records and is emptied every time you shut down your browser.  Lists are permanent places to store bibliographic record lists on your account until you decide to delete the list.
