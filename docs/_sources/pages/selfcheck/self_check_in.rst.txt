Self check-in
=============

Koha has a built in self check-in module that any library can use.

If you would like to use self check-in at your Next Search Catalog library, please contact |nocopy| nexthelp\@nekls.org |spane|


Requirements
------------

To log in to the self check-in module staff need to:

1. The URL for self check-in `(https://nekls.bywatersolutions.com/cgi-bin/koha/sci/sci-main.pl) <https://nekls.bywatersolutions.com/cgi-bin/koha/sci/sci-main.pl>`_
2. A staff username and password with permission to access the self check-in module

For patrons to use the self check-in module, patrons need to:

A. Have an item needing to be checked in with a library barcode number on the item


For staff
---------

1. Go to `<https://nekls.bywatersolutions.com/cgi-bin/koha/sci/sci-main.pl>`_
2. Enter the staff username and password and click submit

  - If you don't have a username and password, contact |nocopy| nexthelp\@nekls.org |spane| to ask for help with self check

  |self_check_in-0010|

3. After staff log in to the self check-in system you should see a check-in prompt

  |self_check_in-0020|

4. When self check-in is no longer needed, go to `(https://nekls.bywatersolutions.com/cgi-bin/koha/opac-main.pl?logout.x=1) <https://nekls.bywatersolutions.com/cgi-bin/koha/opac-main.pl?logout.x=1>`_ to log out of the self check-in system
   
  - (After 10 hours of inactivity, the self check-in system will automatically log off)
  - (At approximately 2:00 a.m. every day, the self check-in system will automatically log off)

  |self_check_in-0030|


For patrons 
-----------

A. At the check-in prompt, enter the library barcode number of the item you wish to check-in and click on "Submit"

  |self_check_in-0040|

B. You can repeat this process as many times as necessary to check in multiple items, then when all of your items have been scanned, click on "Check in"

  |self_check_in-0050|

C. You will then see a display showing you a list of all items and their checked-in status

  |self_check_in-0060|

D. Click "Finish" to return to the self check-in prompt

- IMPORTANT NOTE 

  - You must enter the *library's* barcode number - using an item's UPC barcode (the barcode put on the item by the manufacturer) will cause an error

  |self_check_out-0060|


Notes for staff
---------------

- There is a 60 second timeout for check-in actions.  If someone enters barcode numbers and skips clicking "Check in" at step B, the screen will clear after 60 seconds and none of those items will have been checked in.
- If any items have requests on them, or need to be sent in-transit to another library, the self check-in system will not trigger those holds or transfers.
