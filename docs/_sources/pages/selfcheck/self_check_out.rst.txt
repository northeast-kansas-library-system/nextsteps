  - IMPORTANT NOTE

    - You must use the *library's* barcode - using an item's UPC barcode (the barcode put on the item by the manufacturer) will cause an error

  - At this point you will be asked if you wish to print a receipt or end the session

  |self_check_out-0070|

  - "End session" will log out the current patron and prepare the station for the next borrower
