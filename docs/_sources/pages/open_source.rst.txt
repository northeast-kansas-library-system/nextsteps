Open source software is software that is developed under a license that allows the user of the software to view and alter the source code of the software and to distribute the software to anyone that wants to use it.

A common misconception is that open source software does not have a copyright.  In fact open source software does have a copyright.  It's just that the copyright holder has given license that allows anyone to copy, use, and distribute the software - usually with minimal restrictions.
