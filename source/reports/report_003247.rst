    <ul>
    <li>Summarizes the replacement cost of every item checked out, every time it was checked out at the specified library during the previous calendar month.  If, for example, a $10.00 MOVIE checks out 5 times at one library last month, those checkouts will contribute $50.00 to the total in the column for "MOVIE" at that library for last month.</li>
    <li>This report relies on the accuracy of the data in the 952$v field.  If, for example, the 952$v field has accidentally been sent to $999,999.99 for an item, each time that item checks out in a month, the total value for the VALUE_OF_ALL_ITEMS_CHECKED_OUT column will increase by slightly less than one million dollars.  Similarly, if the 952$v is left blank, no value will be recorded.</li>
    <li>This report only looks at check-outs - it does not record data for renewals.</li>
    </ul>
