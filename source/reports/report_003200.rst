    <p>Counts checkouts and renewals at a library during the previous calendar month based on whether the items circulated were owned by the check-out library or owned by a different library</p>
    <ul><li>Counts circulation and renewals in the previous calendar month</li>
    <li>at all libraries</li>
    <li>grouped and sorted by checkout branchcode</li>
    </ul><br />
    <p><ins>Notes:</ins></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Items that appear in the statistics table without a checkout branch are counted as NEKLS checkouts.</p>
    <p>Items where the owning library cannot be determined will be counted as being owned by NEKLS.</p>
    <p>All items owned by Doniphan County Library District are considered Doniphan County Library District items at all of their libraries - i.e. a DONITROY item checked out at DONIELWD counts as a DONIELWD item.</p>
    <p>All items owned by Prairie Hills School District are considered Prairie Hills School District items at all of their libraries - i.e. a PHWAC item checked out at PHSHS counts as a PHSHS item.</p>
