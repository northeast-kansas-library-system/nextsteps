    <p>Circulation by item details spreadsheet report - circulation by item type</p> 
    <ul><li>Shows counts of check-outs and renewals in the previous calendar month</li>

    <p></p> 
    <p>An item's "shelving location" is based on the shelving location of the item at the time it was checked out *Unless the item had a "Recently returned" shelving location.*  This report falls back to the items' "Permanent shelving location" whenever the statistics data shows that the item's shelving location was "Recently returned."  If the shelving location is completely ambiguous, the circulation is counted in the 'Other items' column.</p>
