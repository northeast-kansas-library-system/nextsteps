    <p>Creates borrower address report for use in Policy Map</p>
    <ul><li>Shows current patron addresses</li>
    <li>at the library you select</li>
    <li>grouped by borrowernumber</li>
    <li>sorted by address</li>
    </ul><br />
    <p><ins>Notes:</ins></p>
    <p></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Patrons with an un-mappable address (PO Box, no address, no city, no state) will not appear in the results</li>
      <li>Patron data may not map correctly if parts of the address are spelled incorrectly</li>
      <li>YEAR_LASTSEEN is the year from the last_updated field in the borrowers table - this data has only been available since June of 2019, so it will not start being reliable or valuable until June of 2020</li>
      <li>YEAR_LASTSEEN is updated whenever the patron account is used for checking out materials, renewing materials,  or logging into a SIP enabled system (such as Hoopla, PC Reservation, Libki, or Cybrarian - to name a few)</li>
      <li>STATUS = Active means that the patron has checked out or renewed materials within the previous 12 months</li>
      <li>STATUS = Inactive means that the patron has not checked out or renewed any materials in the previous 12 months</li>
    </ul>
