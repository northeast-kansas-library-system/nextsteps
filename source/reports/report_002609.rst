    The report returns patron's holds on records where, at the time of the hold placing, the record had items available to fulfill holds, but for a number of reasons, no items remain available at this time to fulfill the holds, due to:<br />
    <br />
    1) Last item available is overdue by 30+ days. <br />
    2) Last item available is marked lost/damaged/withdrawn.<br />
    3) Last item available is now not for loan (report ignores items with on-order status)<br />
    <br />
    The report returns a link to your patron's account, the patron's name, when the hold was placed and a link to the record.<br />
    <br />
    Please do the following to clean these up: <br />
    <br />
    1) Determine if your patron still wants the requested material. <br />
    2) If the patron does still want the item, delete the hold, and either see if another record of the same title, similar format, is available in NExpress or request through ILL.<br />
    3) If your patron does not want the item, please delete the hold. <br />
