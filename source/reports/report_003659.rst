    <p>Shows borrowers sorted by their "Last borrowed" date but only if the last borrowed date was less than 25 months in the past.</p>
    <ul><li>With the home library you specify</li>
    <li>grouped by borrowernumber</li>
    <li>sorted by LAST_BORROWED date</li>
    <li>links to the borrower record</li>
    </ul><br />

    <p></p>
    <p>This report gets the "LAST_BORROWED" dates from the statistics table in Koha.  As a matter of data security, Next Search Catalog only keeps data in the statistics table for the previous 25 months, therefore, the "LAST_BORROWED" date will never be more than 25 months in the past.</p>
