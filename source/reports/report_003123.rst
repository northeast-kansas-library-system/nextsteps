    <div id=reportinfo>
    <p>Counts checkouts and renewals at a library based on an index term (marc field 655$a)</p>
    <ul><li>Shows circulation in the previous 24 months (will not include current month or partial months)</li>
    <li>checked out at the library you specify</li>
    <li>grouped and sorted by year, month, and owning library</li>
    </ul><br />
    <p><ins>Notes:</ins></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>The search will be conducted based on the term or terms you enter.  For example, if you enter "Fiction" you will see all results where at least one 655$a contains the word "Fiction" - i.e. Fiction, Fantasy fiction, Legal fiction, Horror fiction, Romance fiction, etc.  If you put in "Fantasy fiction" you will only see results where at least one 655$a contains the phrase "Fantasy fiction" in that order with the space between the two words.  The search is not case sensitive so "legal" and "Legal" will return the same results.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Also note that any home branch code that ends with "-deleted" indicates a title that checked out in the month specified but has been deleted from the catalog within the last 13 months.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>To check a word or phrase to see how many titles in the catalog contain that word or phrase in the 655$a, run report 3124 (<a href="/cgi-bin/koha/reports/guided_reports.pl?reports=3124&phase=Run%20this%20report"  target="_blank">click here to run report 3124 in a new window.</a>)</p>
