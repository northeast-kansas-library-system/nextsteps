    <div id=reportinfo>
    <p>Counts circulation (checkouts + renewals) on items checked out between the beginning of the day on DATE1 and the end of the day on DATE2 and groups them by shelving location</p>
    <ul><li>Shows items checked out or renewed between two specified dates (between 12:00 a.m. on DATE1 and 11:59 p.m. on DATE2</li>
    <li>shows items checked out at the specified library</li>
    <li>grouped by item check-out branch</li>
    <li>sorted by item check-out branch and shelving location</li>
    </ul><br />
    <p><ins>Notes:</ins></p>
    <p class="updated">SHELVING_LOCATION is based on the shelving location of the item at the time it was checked out *Unless the item had a "Recently returned" shelving location.*  This report falls back to the items' "Permanent shelving location" whenever the statistics data shows that the item's shelving location was "Recently returned."</p>
    <p>Report created by GHW at the request of LEAVENWRTH so they could track circulation of items on display.</p>
    <p>Items without a shelving location will be recorded as having a shelving location of "Adult."</p>
    <p></p>
    <p class="updated">Updated on 2021.10.20 to include changes based on the "Recently returned" shelving location.</p>
