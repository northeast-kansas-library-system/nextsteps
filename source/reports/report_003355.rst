    <p>Circulation by borrower details - Unique borrowers in the previous calendar month</p> 
    <ul>
      <li>Shows borrower counts on each day of the month for the previous month</li> 
      <li>includes a unique borrower account per month in the final column</li> 
      <li>At all Next Search Catalog libraries</li> 
      <li>grouped and sorted by the library where the borrower checked out or renewed items</li> 
    </ul>
    <br /> 
    <p><ins>Notes:</ins></p> 
    <p></p> 
    <p>A borrower is counted as 1 borrower if they check out or renew materials on the day specified.  If a borrower checks out 10 items at 10:00 a.m. and then checks out additional items at 4:00 p.m., that borrower is only counted once for the purposes of this report.</p> 
    <p></p> 
    <p>The final column is a monthly count of unique borrowers.  So if a borrower checks out 1 book on the first of the month and then checks out 1 book on the 15th of the month, that borrower is only counted as 1 unique borrower in the final column of this report.</p>
