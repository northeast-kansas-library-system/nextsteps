Cataloging basics

This is an update of the basic Next Search Catalog training for 2024.

The cataloging committee organized by Robin Hastings at NEKLS is working on a more complete cataloging guide.


Basic steps to adding a record to Next Search Catalog:
======================================================

There are really only 3 steps to adding an item to Next Search Catalog.  The trouble is that there are 3 possibilities that can happen when you get to step 2

1. Search for the title to see if it's already in Next Search Catalog


    2. A - If the title is already in the catalog, confirm that it's truly a matching record then go to step 3

    2. B - If the title is not in the catalog, copy an existing matching record then go to step 3

    2. C - If no bibliographic record can be found, create a brief record then go to step 3


3. Add your item to the bibliographic record


Step 1: Searching for a bibliographic record
============================================

  The first step in adding an item to the catalog is to search the existing catalog to see if the title already exists in Next Search Catalog.  The following document has best practices for searching for an existing bibliographic record:

    - :doc:`/cataloging_basics/search_for_exitsting_record`


Step 2A: Record is already in catalog
=====================================

  If your item accurately matches a bibliographic record that already exists in Next Search Catalog, go to :ref:`step 3 <Step 3: Adding an item to a bibliographic record>` and attach your item to the existing bibliographic record


Step 2B: Record is not in catalog, but can be found elsewhere
=============================================================

  If you cannot find an accurate match in Next Search Catalog, the next step is to search for a bibliographic record using the Z39.50 search engine.

    - :doc:`/cataloging_basics/z39_50`

  If you cannot find an accurate match in Next Search Catalog or through a Z39.50 search, your next step would be to search in ShareIt.  Click here for information on how to import a record through ShareIt.

    - :doc:`/cataloging_basics/shareit`

  Some libraries have access to cataloging through OCLC's WorldCat service, through their book vendor, or through other services.  If you cannot find a record through Z39.50 or ShrareIt, you can add a record using these other services if you are able.  Getting the record to your computer will vary depending on the service.  Once you have the record, though, the process would follow the steps outlined here.

    - :doc:`/cataloging_basics/stage_and_import_record`

Step 2: No record can be found
==============================

  If you cannot find a bibliogrpahic record from any other source, you can add a brief record by following the instructions below:

  :doc:`/cataloging_basics/brief_record_cataloging`


Step 3: Adding an item to a bibliographic record
================================================

  Once you've found, copied, or created a bibliogrpahic record, you need to add your item to that bibliogrpahic record:

ILL Cataloging
==============

There are several ways to handle ILL records.  Options are described below:

:doc:`/cataloging_basics/ill_brief_record_cataloging`

:doc:`/cataloging_basics/ill_stub_record_cataloging`



On order cataloging
===================

:doc:`/cataloging_basics/on_order_item`

:doc:`/cataloging_basics/on_order_record`

Next Search Catalog classification
==================================

Cataloging and Classification are different things.

Cataloging is how a librarian adds information about a resource to a bibliographic record.

Classification is the system libraries use to describe how to find an item they have cataloged.

Simply put, cataloging is about how records are created and classification is about finding the items in the catalog.

A description of how Next Search Catalog classifies items can be found here:

:doc:`/cataloging_basics/classification`
