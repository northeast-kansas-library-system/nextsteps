Adding items to bibliographic records
*************************************

**When adding items, please be sure that you are adding your items to the correct record.**

Once you've found a bibliographic record that you're going to add an item to, follow these steps:

Adding 1 item to a bibliographic record
=======================================

1. From the biblographic record, click on "New item" from the "New +" drop-down-button

    |adding_item_to_record_0010|

2. On the Add/Edit page, you should update the following fields:

    - Home library *(required)*

      - (should default to your library)

    - Current library *(required)*

      - (should default to your library)

    - Shelving location *(required)*
    - Item type *(required)*
    - Collection code *(required)*
    - Full call number
    - Barcode
    - Copy number

      - *(Only used at a few libraries in Next)*

    - Cost, replacement price

      - *(If you don't fill this in and a borrower loses the item, they will never be billed for the item's replacement)*

C. Additionally you can add these optional fields:

    - Date acquired

      - *if you click on this field, it will auto-populate today's date*

    - Source of acquisition

      - *not required but most libraires use this field to track where they purchased the item*

    - Cost, normal purchase price

      - *the cover price on the book*

    - Non-public note
    - Public note
    - Materials specified

      - *(A place to note how many pieces are included in things like audio books or board games)*

D. If you only have one item to add to the record, once the fields are filled, click on "Add item" to finish adding the item

    |adding_item_to_record_0040|

Adding 2 items to a bibliographic record at once
================================================

- If you have two copies of the same title to add to a record, follow all of the steps for adding 1 item but instead of clicking "Add item", click on "Add and duplicate" instead

    When you click on "Add and duplicate" the first item will be added and the form will reset with all of the data from the first item duplicated except the barcode number

    |adding_item_to_record_0050|

Adding up to 10 items to a bibliographic record at once
=======================================================

- If you have more than 2 copies of the same title to add to a record and your barcode numbers are in sequence (1, 2, 3, 4 . . .), once you've finished adding the first, click "Add multiple copies of this item."

    |adding_item_to_record_0060|

- A new field will open that will allow you to enter the total number of items (up to 10) that you're going to add to this record

    |adding_item_to_record_0070|

-  All of the items you add using this method will have barcode nubers added in sequence starting with the first number you enter. For example, if you are adding 5 copies and the first has barcode number 1006, the items will have barcode numbers 1006, 1007, 1008, 1009, and 1010.
