Seting an *on hold* status
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The in *on hold* process is automatic.  An item with a hold on it can only trigger the on hold status when it is checked in at the library where the borrower has requested to pick it up.

What happens at check-in
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When you check in an item that has been requested for pickup at your library:

#. The item is checked in from the borrower's account (if it's checked out)
#. The items' last seen date is updated 
#. The item's shelving location *is not* temporarily updated to "Recently returned"
#. Once you click the "Confirm hold" button, the borrower will be automatically contacted by e-mail or text message (if they are configured to receive those automatic messages)
#. A check-in message will appear asking you to confirm the hold
