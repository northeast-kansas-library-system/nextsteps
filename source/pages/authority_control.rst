Authority control
*****************

We are currently in the process of adding authority control to Next Search Catalog.

During the testing phase staff will not be able to edit or delete items that were added before April 1, 2023.

Staff will be notified when the testing is done and the cataloging freeze has been lifted.

There is a work-around that allows staff to delete items while the cataloging freeze is in effect.  Please see below for more information:
