Checkout blocked: on hold wating for someone else
=================================================

- If you try to check out an item from the hold shelf to a library card other than the one that has requested it, you should see this message

  - One of the most typical causes of this message is when one member of a family places a request and asks a different family member to pick up the item
  - This block can be overridden by some library staff
  - How you proceed will depend on the situation and on the policies and procedures at your library
