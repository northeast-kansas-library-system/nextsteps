Checkout blocked: on hold in transit
====================================

- If a borrower has placed a request on a title and the item has already been shipped to another library, you should see this message

  - This situation usually means that someone made a mistake when checking an item in
  - This block can be overridden by some library staff
  - How you proceed will depend on the situation and on the policies and procedures at your library
