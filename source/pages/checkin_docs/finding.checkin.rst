Finding the Check-in menu
=========================

The check-in menu can be found on the circulation menu

The check-in menu can also be found by checking an item in using the flexible search box (which can be found at the top of almost every page).

After you enter a barcode number through "Check in" on the flexible search box, that item will be checked in and you will be taken to the check-in menu.
