Forgive overdue charges
=======================

- If you check the "Forgive overdue charges" checkbox, any currently accruing late fees for any items being checked in will be written off

  - For example, if a borrower is returning a copy of DAY OF THE JACKAL that is currently accruing a $.10 late fee for each day it is overdue, those fees will not be assessed when the item is checked in
  - However, if a borrower returned that same copy of DAY OF THE JACKAL 2 years ago and received a total fee of $2.10 for that item, that fee will remain on that borrower's account
  - Only the *currently accruing fee* will be forgiven
