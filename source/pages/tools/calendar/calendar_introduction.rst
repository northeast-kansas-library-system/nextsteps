Calendar - introduction, tips, problems
=======================================

The calendar in Next Search Catalog allows you to set dates that your library is closed.

Adding closures to your library's calendar allows Next Search Catalog to automatically set due dates based on the days your library is open or closed.  If you calendar is set to be closed every Thursday, for example, no items checked out at your library will be due on Thursdays.  If you calendar is set to be closed on July 4, no items will be due on July 4.  Any time that an item is checked out, the calendar ensures that items will not be due on days that are marked as closed dates or holidays on your library's calendar.  If an item would normally be due on a closed date, the due date will be pushed to the next day your library is open.

The calendar affects due dates and late fees.
