********************

Open source software is software that is developed under a license that allows the user of the software to view, and alter the source code of the software and to distribute the software to anyone that wants to use it.

A common misconception is that open source software does not have a copyright.  In fact open source software does have a copyright.  It's just that the copyright holder has given license to anyone interested to copy, use, and distribute the software - usually with minimal restrictions.

This website you are reading right now, in fact, is released under a Creative Commons 4 Attribution license.  What this means is that anyone is allowed to copy, share, and modify the content of this website so long as you:

#. Give credit to Northeast Kansas Library System when you use the materials you share, copy, or modify
#. Provide a link to the CC BY 4.0 license that this content is released under
#. Indicate if any changes were made to the content
#. Don't impose any restrictions greater than those provided to in the CC BY 4.0 license that the original content was created under
