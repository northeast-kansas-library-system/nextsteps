Through Next Search Catalog, library users can easily and rapidly obtain library materials that may not be available in their local library collections.  Borrowers can use their library card at any other Next Search Catalog library.

Next Search Catalog began in 2004 with nine participating libraries and a goal of providing convenient, rapid, and direct access to the shared collections of all participating libraries.  Currently there are 45 libraries participating in Next at 52 library branch locations.
