Report 3658 - Missing in transit items
======================================

This report generates a list of items that are considered "Missing in transit" - i.e. items that have been in transit from one library to another for more than 7 days.

The report will show you results for:

- All items owned by the selected library
- All items in transit *to* the selected library
- All items in transit *from* the selected library

This report includes a "mailto:" button.  In other words, if you click on the "Send e-mail" button and you have a default e-mail client set up on your computer, the report will trigger an e-mail that you can send to the owning, sending, and receiving libraries asking them to check their shelves for the in-transit item.

To run this report:
