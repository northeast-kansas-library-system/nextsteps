History
=======

Library catalogs have been around as long as libraries have.  In its most basic form, a library catalog is a list of all of the titles owned by a library.

Up until the late 1780s, most early library catalogs consisted of books containing lists of the titles that were housed in a library and those books were updated from time to time.  The problem with storing catalog information in a book comes when you add or remove books from the library's collection.  Adding or deleting a title means that you have to edit the book.  This all changed in the late 1780s.

During the French Revolution, the Revolutionary government seized books from all kinds of places.  Books from private, academic, monastic libraries, and other institutions and private collectors were confiscated in an effort to make knowledge more accessible to the general public.  Librarians dealt with the chaos created by the flood of confiscated books by writing down bibliographic information on the backs of playing cards.  Playing cards were readily available and, at that time, the backs of cards were usually blank.  Because cards were more durable than slips of paper and because they were easy to sort, file, and resort when new books were added to a collection, within about 30 years card catalogs were widely adopted by libraries as the standard form of catalog.  By 1900 the Library of Congress had become the de-facto national library of the USA and engaged in the business of selling library catalog cards to public libraries throughout the US.  At the end of each month librarians would send the Library of Congress a list of titles they had added to their collections and, for a small fee, the Library of Congress would print cards to go with those titles for the requesting library.  This made library catalogs throughout the US very consistent.

By the 1960s, though, computers were becoming more available for business solutions.  Really large libraries like the Library of Congress and large university libraries were facing serious space issues caused by their large card catalogs.  At some point some cataloger somewhere said "Hey, wouldn't it be great if we could put all of this catalog information on a computer?"

At the same time catalogers were struggling with card catalogs, circulation staff had similar issues with patron data.  By the 1960s most libraries kept borrower information on cards similar to card catalog cards and had similar issues as catalogers.  Someone at a circulation desk somewhere said "Hey, wouldn't it be great if we could put all of this borrower information on a computer?"

The library of congress tackled the first issue in the late 1960s when they developed the Marc cataloging format.  Marc stands for Machine Readable Code and it's very similar to the file format that we are still using 55 years later.  And at some point, someone in the cataloging department ran into someone from the circulation department and the two of them started talking about their goals of computerizing their data.

And then one of them said "What if we integrated the cataloging information and the borrower information?  Then we could use the computer to track who has something checked out and when it's due."

This was the beginning of the integrated library system.

A cataloging system for storing information about books and other library materials.
A patron information system for storing information about the people who borrow the books and other materials.
Integration of the two systems so that you can track which borrower has borrowed which book.

Since that basic integration, other components have been added.  Most Integrated Library Systems include:

- Holds module - tracks requests for materials
- Serials module - helps track magazine subscriptions
- Acquisitions module - helps track materials budgets and ordering information
- OPAC - Online Public Access Catalog - allows patrons to search the catalog and manage their account
