Staff account permissions
=========================

To give a new account permission to access the staff client:

1. Have the library director create an account for the new user using a dummy account 
2. Have the director send you the account's userid 
3. Make sure the account has the "Staff - system login (exempt)" category
4. Log into Koha using the NEKLSADMIN account 
5. Check the account and make sure everything is correctly set up 
6. Add the account to the appropriate staff account list 

  - Currently these are:

    - Z-Staff-1-director
    - Z-Staff-2-tech
    - Z-staff-3-circ
    - Z-Staff-4-assistant
    - Z-Staff-5-self-check
    - Z-Staff-6-superlibrarian

7. Go to the template account associated with that list, click on "Set perissions" for that template, and then click on "Save"
8. Clicking on "Save" should automatically update the permissions on all borrowers associated with this template
