********************
Report 3658 Training
********************

Purpose of report 3658
======================

The purpose of this report is to help staff at member libraries find materials that have been missing in transit for more than 7 days.

This report generates a list of items that have been in transit from one library to another for more than 7 days.

The report will show you results for:

- All items **owned** by the selected library
- All items in transit **to** the selected library
- All items in transit **from** the selected library

Frequency for running report 3658
=================================

Ideally, each library should run this report and try to resolve the issues with these items once a month.

The best practice for finding materials that are missing in transit is to run report 3658 once a week and then:

1. Search for all of the items at your library - checking in any items you find
2. E-mailing the other libraries involved in the transfer about the items you don't find and asking them to do a shelf check
3. Contacting the courier coordinator at NEKLS following the courier guidelines when necessary
4. Marking un-found items as "Missing (unable to locate on shelf)" after all attempts by all libraries and the courier have failed

Finding report 3658
===================

You can find report 3658 following the instructions in :ref:`"Finding a report by number" <Finding a report by number>`

Report 3658 parameters and their defaults
=========================================

- Sort by 

  - **Default** = Normal sort order including item home library |br| |br|

- Choose your library 

  - **Default** = Atchison Public Library

You will be asked to choose a sort order
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

"Normal sort order including home library" (this is the default sort order) sorts the results by:

- Home library
- Permanent location
- Item type
- Collection code
- Call number
- Author
- Title

"Normal sort order without item home library" sorts the results by:

- Permanent location
- Item type
- Collection code
- Call number
- Author
- Title

Sorting without the home library creates a shelf-list that may be easier for staff to print and use when searching the shelves at your library.

Click on "Send e-mail" to send the item data to the owning library, sending library, and receiving library
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This report includes a "mailto:" button.  If you click on the "Send e-mail" button and you have a default e-mail client set up on your computer, the report will auto-populate an e-mail that you can send to the owning, sending, and receiving libraries asking them to check their shelves for the in-transit item.

*This feature will only work if you have a default e-mail program set up on the computer you're using.*
