#. What should the best practices be for claims returned items (OTTAWA)

    - Specifically OTTAWA wanted to know about what to do when a different library marks one of your items as "Claims returned."
    - `Interlibrary Loan Code for the United States <http://www.ala.org/rusa/guidelines/interlibrary>`_

      - Basically says that if you send something to another library and they don't return it, you can bill them for the replacement cost of the item
      - Next Search Catalog policy says that you can bill a library for your items that were lost by their borrowers 90 days after the item is marked as lost

    - Report 2915

#. Cancelling a hold when in transit (ATCHISON)

    - This is very similar to the last topic - if an item you own is lost en route to or from another library, the ILL code says that the other library is responsible for returning the item or replacing it
    - This doesn't take the KLE courier into account - If things are going missing, you should contact Caroline
    - If it's between two Next Search Catalog libraries, you can also use the "Missing in transit" reports on the front of the reports page to identify items that have been in transit for a long time

    ..
      We had several items that had been in transit from Basehor since last September. One item ended up at the Atchison County Library in Missouri. Cindy cancelled the other two and called Basehor. They did a shelf check and the books were not there. The issue is how does the owning library know the item has gone missing if the other library doesn't call?

#. Discussion of patrons reporting claims returned (LEAVENWRTH)

    - LEAVENWRTH believes that they are experiencing an increase in finding things on the shelves that were not checked in
    - The question is "Is this human error, a software glitch, or something else."
    - Is anyone interested in trying to study this phenomenon?  It would be best if 3-4 libraries would take part.  The study would probably take 1 year - possibly 2.

    ..
      Are libraries experiencing an uptick in how often patrons are reporting material not c/in, even after quarantine is completed, and the item is found on the libraryâ€™s shelf?
       Is this changing your workflow, like checking in all material twice before shelving?
       It has been reported that multiple libraries in the area are dealing with a c/in issue. There is an interest in discovering if this widespread and possibly more than human error.

    ..
      24 years ago we had this problem at the University of Idaho library where we were using the CARL ILS.
      23 years ago we had this problem at Boise Public Library where we were using the Dynix ILS.
      16 years ago we had this problem at Latah County Library District where we were using Voyager.
      9 years ago LCLD switched to Koha and we still had this problem.

#. Circulation/fees/request rules report fixes

    - Due to major changes in how Koha manages circulation rules, report 3340 is irreparably damaged
    - Report 3486, 3487, and 3488 are the replacements
      - 3486 covers checkouts and renewals
      - 3487 covers late fees and "suspensions"
      - 3488 covers requests and some miscellaneous rules
      - Future reports will cover the parts of the rules tables that are outside of the circulation matrix

#. Weeding tools from Collection Development 2.0 with Gail Santy

    - `Collection Development 2.0 link <https://www.nekls.org/collection-development-2-0-with-gail-santy/>`_
    - `Tools for Next Search Catalog <https://northeast-kansas-library-system.github.io/next/statistics/analysis.tools.html>`_
      - Reports 2731, 3475, 3476, 3483, 3484
      - Spreadsheet tool #1
      - Spreadsheet tool #2
      - `Collection Development 1.0 <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlDqCnZZyvI>`_ (link added after the meeting ended)
