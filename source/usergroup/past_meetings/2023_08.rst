    - We will go over this document piece by piece at this meeting and revew confideniality in general
    - Sometime by the end of 2024 there will be a "click-through" on the login page of the staff-client

#. 2024 plan to create a Next Search Catalog privacy policy

    - Based on principals of GDPR (`GDPR principals from EU <https://gdpr-info.eu/art-5-gdpr/>`_)
    - `Pathfinder Central privacy policy <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1H96HVvmJ85Ea88Yv4utZvIzEq4cLQ5bx/view?pli=1>`_
    - Informs patrons what data is kept in Next Search Catalog and how they go about removing their data
    - "Do you consent to cookies" messages are coming to the Koha OPAC soon
 
#. Removing the "Female/Male/Other/None specified" buttons on borrower accounts

    - On August 26, 2023, these buttons will be removed from Next (with the upgrade)
    - On September 15, 2023, all "Female/Male/Other/None specified" data in Next Search Catalog will be deleted
    - Run report 3752 on or before September 14 if you wish to get a borrower count based on this data 

#. Change the "noissuecharges" system preference from $10.00

    - This system preference prevents borrowers from checking out items, renewing, etc. when they owe more than $10.00
    - Some libraries feel that $10.00 is too low

#. Item type issues 

    - Unused and will be deleted soon
 
      - E-content : E-learning course

    - Most uses of these items types are redundant or could be better done with other item types: 

      - Special collections (local requests only) 
      - Video (Local requests only) 
      - Video (No requests allowed)

    - Next Search Catalog will be able to automatically block the miss-use of the "Book (local requests only)" and "Book (no requests allowed)" item types after the next upgrade cycle

    - I'm working on a document that lists and describes every current existing item type

#. Changes to borrower categories coming in 2024:

    - Student (exempt) - school district use only
    - Student (public library) - public library use only
    - Teacher/Faculty/Administrator (exempt) - school district use only
    - Teacher/Faculty/Administrator (public library) - public library use only
    - Homeschool (proposed new borrower category)
    - Many borrower category codes will change in 2024
